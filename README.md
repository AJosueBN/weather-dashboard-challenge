# week-six-weather-dashboard-challenge This challenge involves third-party APIs/server-side APIs and will be tasked to access data and functionallity by making requests with specific parameters to a URL.This will run in the browser 

# Will be retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Will specifically be using the 5 Day Weather Forecast API.

# Things I have added/implemented to the task of creating a weather dashboard:

- Added functions involving the current weather and the forecast within the next five days and done this with the elements provided in the page and use it for data to get back info when the user searches for a city with form inputs
- Can be presented with the city name,date and an icon representation of the temperature,humidity and wind speed within the current day and the weather conditions within the next five days
